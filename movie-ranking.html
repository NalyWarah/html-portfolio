<h1>The Best Movies According to Naly</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<h3>Miracles from Heaven</h3>
<p>A sad story with a miraculous ending. 
It shows the viewers God working in every one of us even when we don't see it.</p>

<h3>Cluless</h3>
<p>It's an all time classic! who doesn't love a good 90's chick flick!</p>

<h3>The Brady Bunch Movie</h3>
<p>There's a Brady in our yard! who can forget that line? 
    it's a classic that's quite memorable!</p>
