<p>About Me</p>

I'm really excited to learn how to code. 
What a blessing to have the opportunity to be able to 
learn a new skill in the IT field. I'm still in the early 
stages of learning HTML. So far, I'm finding it rather 
intriguing. I look forward to future HTML projects.</p>

<p>I've been working in IT for over ten years. 
I've worked with routing and switching, as well as 
Active Directory, system management, VOIP and firewalls.</p>

<p>I want to expand my expertise in the IT area, and I believe 
that learning to code will be an excellent approach to do so.</p>

<p>There have already been some challenages in the early phases, but that is where the pleasure is. The more challenages I face, the more I learn.
My long-term goal is to study HTML, CSS, and JAVA Script.
According to what I've heard, Java Script is the most 
difficult, however I believe it is possible to learn and 
eventually master it with the correct amount of practice and 
dedication.</p>
